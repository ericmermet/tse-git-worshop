# Git Extra Commands

## To do before all extra commands, just get information

git status
```

## Change Branch Name

To rename the current branch:

## How to ignore files

Create a .gitignore file

In MacOs, for example you need to add .DS_Store*
You can also add all temporary file, or your Python venv.

## How to clean history of a file :

```

## How to save your uncommited changes, just save it, don't commit

If you need to change your branch, save your change on your branch before

```sh
git stash
```

Then you can reapply your changes from your stash with 

```sh
git stash pop
```

Or copy and keep in your stash

```sh
git stash apply
```

Need to stash untracked files (in gitignore) with option -u means --include-untracked

```sh
git stash apply -u
```

You can also list stash :

```sh
git stash list
```
