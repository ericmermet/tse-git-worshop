# Working with git in CLI (commande line) 

## Cloning a Repository

To clone a repository, use the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Creating a New Branch
To create a new branch, use the following command:

```sh
git branch <branch_name>
```

## Listing Branches
To list all branches, use the following command:

```sh
git branch
```

## Switching to a Branch
To switch to a branch, use the following command:

```sh
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## Adding and Committing Changes
### Adding Files

```sh
git add <file_name>
```

or add all files

```sh
git add . 
```

### Committing Changes
To commit changes, use the following command:

```sh
git commit -m "commit message"
```

## Pushing Changes
To push changes to the remote repository, use the following command:

```sh
git push origin <branch_name>
```

## Example Workflow
### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Create a new branch:

```sh
git branch new-feature
```

### Switch to the new branch:

```sh
git checkout new-feature
```

### Add a new file:

```sh
git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

### Commit the new file:

```sh
git commit -m "Update hello.txt"
```

### Modify an existing file:

```sh
echo "Hello, World!" >> hello.txt
git add hello.txt
```

### Commit the changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Update hello.txt"
```

### Push the changes to the remote repository:

```sh
git push origin new-feature
```

## Pull

### Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

```sh
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

## Example Usage of pulling

### Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:

```sh
git pull origin main
```

### Handle merge conflicts if any:
If there are merge conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Open the conflicting files, make the necessary changes, and then add the resolved files:

```sh
git add <resolved_file>
```

### Commit the merge:
After resolving conflicts and adding the resolved files, commit the merge:

```sh
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```
