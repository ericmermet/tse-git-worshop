# Git Training for Beginners

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with other developers. It is widely used in software development to manage the source code of projects of all sizes.

The objectives of this workshop are:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Git
- Learn to use basic Git commands
- Know how to manage branches and work with remote repositories
- Acquire practical skills through exercises and collaborative workflow simulations

## Part 1: Git Basics (1h)
1. **Introduction to Git**
    - What is Git?
       It is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files.. It is a free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.
      It works with a local copy of the entire repository, a.k.a. repo, with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server, viewed as a folder.
      It has a feature to synchronize changes between repos that share history; copied (cloned) from each other, even remotely.
