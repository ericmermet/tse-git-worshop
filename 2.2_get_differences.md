# Using `git diff`

## Introduction
`git diff` is a command used to display differences between various states of a Git repository. It allows you to compare files, branches, commits, or the index against the working directory.

## Use Cases

### 1. Compare Unstaged Changes
To show differences between unstaged changes and the current version in the repository:
```bash
git diff
```

### 2. Compare Staged Changes
To view differences between staged files and the last commit:
```bash
git diff --cached
```
Or:
```bash
git diff --staged
```

### 3. Compare Two Branches
To display differences between two branches:
```bash
git diff branch1 branch2
```
For example:
```bash
git diff main feature-branch
```

### 4. Compare Two Commits
To compare two specific commits:
```bash
git diff commit1 commit2
```
For example:
```bash
git diff 3f45e9d 1a2b3c4
```

### 5. Compare a Commit with the Index or Working Directory
To see differences between a given commit and the working directory:
```bash
git diff commit
```
To compare a commit with the index:
```bash
git diff --cached commit
```

### 6. Compare a Specific File
To show differences for a specific file:
```bash
git diff path/to/file
```

### 7. Use Output Options
- **Show only modified file names:**
  ```bash
  git diff --name-only
  ```
- **Show modification statistics:**
  ```bash
  git diff --stat
  ```

### 8. Visualize Differences with External Tools
To use a graphical diff tool:
```bash
git difftool
```

## Practical Scenarios

### Example 1: Verify Changes Before Committing
1. Modify a file.
2. Run `git diff` to check the changes made.
3. Stage the changes with `git add`.
4. Confirm staged changes with `git diff --cached`.

### Example 2: Compare Two Branches Before Merging
1. Compare branches with:
   ```bash
   git diff main feature-branch
   ```
2. Resolve any conflicts before running the `git merge` command.

### Example 3: Code Review
Use `git diff` to check changes in specific files before submitting a pull request.

## Useful Options
- **Ignore whitespace changes:**
  ```bash
  git diff --ignore-space-change
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  git diff -b
  ```
- **Ignore blank lines:**
  ```bash
  git diff --ignore-blank-lines
  ```

## Conclusion
The `git diff` command is a powerful tool for managing changes in a Git repository. By combining its various options, you can tailor the output to meet your specific needs, making it essential for effective collaboration in version-controlled projects.
